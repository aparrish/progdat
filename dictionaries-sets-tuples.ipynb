    "# Dictionaries, Sets, Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "By [Allison Parrish](http://www.decontextualize.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "The dictionary is a very useful data structure in Python. The easiest way to conceptualize a dictionary is that it's like a spreadsheet with two columns: the \"key\" column, and the \"value\" column. Unlike a spreadsheet (or a Python list), dictionaries are implemented in such a way that it is very fast and efficient to find values by looking up their corresponding key.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to focus here just on learning how to get data *out* of dictionaries, not how to build new dictionaries from existing data. We're also going to omit some of the nitty-gritty details about how dictionaries work internally. As a consequence, some of what I'm going to tell you will seem weird and magical. Be prepared!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why dictionaries?\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, the benefit of having data that can be parsed into dictionaries, as opposed to lists, is that dictionary keys tend to be *mnemonic*. That is, a dictionary key will usually tell you something about what its value is. (This is in opposition to parsing, say, CSV data, where we have to keep counting fields in the header row and translating that to the index that we want.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists and dictionaries work together and are used extensively to represent all different kinds of data. Often, when we get data from a remote source, or when we choose how to represent data internally, we'll use both in tandem. The most common form this will take is representing a table, or a database, as a *list* of records that are themselves represented as *dictionaries* (mapping the name of the column to the value for that column).\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are also good for storing *associations* or *mappings* for quick lookups. For example, if you wanted to write a program that was able to recall the capital city of every US state, you might use a dictionary whose keys are the names of the states, and whose values are the corresponding capitals. Dictionaries are also used for data analysis tasks, like keeping track of how many times a particular token occurs in an incoming data stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What dictionaries look like\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, surrounding a series of comma-separated pairs of *keys* and *values*. Here's a very simple dictionary, with one key, `Obama`, associated with a value, `Hawaii`:"

    "\n",
    "\"So,\" you think to yourself. \"Tuples are just like... broken lists. That's strange and a little unreasonable. Why even have them in your programming language?\" That's a fair question, and answering it requires a bit of knowledge of how Python works with these two kinds of values (lists and tuples) behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, tuples are *faster* and *smaller* than lists. Because lists can be modified, potentially becoming larger after they're initialized, Python has to allocate more memory than is strictly necessary whenever you create a list value. If your list grows beyond what Python has already allocated, Python has to allocate more memory. Allocating memory, copying values into memory, and then freeing memory when it's when no longer needed, are all (perhaps surprisingly) slow processes—slower, at least, than using data already loaded into memory when your program begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because a tuple can't grow or shrink after it's created, Python knows exactly how much memory to allocate when you create a tuple in your program. That means: less wasted memory, and less wasted time allocating a deallocating memory. The cost of this decreased resource footprint is less versatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are often called an immutable data type. \"Immutable\" in this context simply means that it can't be changed after it's created.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuple unpacking in `for` loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Python \"unpacks\" lists of tuples in `for` loops. This means that a `for` loop can technically have more than one temporary variable name in the initial `for` statement; those temporary variables will be filled, in order, with the tuples from the list that you are iterating over. For example, here we have a list of tuples:"
